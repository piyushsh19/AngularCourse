A directive is a way in which we can Bind a particlar behaviour to element or component. eg - NgStyle.

NgStyle

It is more power style binding style when we have mutilple objects.under the hood its (ng-reflect-ng-style).
In ngstyle we need to add a valid property name like background to  "background-color". Also for font size we can do "font-size.px" : "20", if we recieve data from api.
We can also pass a style function getStyle()
